This is site built from the terminal and text editor that is generated statically with Jekyll and hosted on Github pages.

Mostly a collection of written articles, code samples, and tests.

A few of my interests include: international economics, languages, programming, business. I can be contacted at lukevinze (at) gmail.com. I hope that you find some of the content on the website to be interesting.

Thanks,

Lucas Vinze
