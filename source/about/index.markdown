Streaming Longitude

Meaning: Nothing. I got it from a name generator, but it seems to invoke a visual of travel, the flow of information... but in reality it means nothing.

This site really is a random collection of written articles, code samples, and tutorials of things I like.

A few of my interests include: international economics, foreign languages, programming languages, business, negotiation, new technologies, history, most types of music, playing the guitar, 
Crossfit, mountain biking, pole vaulting, and, of course, reading. 

I can be contacted at lukevinze (at) gmail.com.

I hope that you find some of the content on the website to be interesting.

Thanks,
