This site really is a random collection of written articles, code samples, and tutorials.

A few of my interests include: international economics, foreign languages, programming languages, business, negotiation, new technologies, history, music, guitar. I can be contacted at lukevinze (at) gmail.com. I hope that you find some of the content on the website to be interesting.

Thanks,

Lucas Vinze
