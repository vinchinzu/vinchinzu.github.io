## Is Chinese the Future Lingua Franca? 
by Lucas Vinze


I wrote this article in 2011 while working on my masters degree from Texas A&M. I was studying at the Shanghai Institute of International Studies in Shanghai, China. The original work was written for the US Department of State's Virtual Internship program.

中文会是未来的全球语言吗？

我刚来到上海学国际关系。 我跟我的中国同学和朋友就只能说一点点中文，而且只是像表达基本的想法之类的很简单的中文。 
最近， 我认识了一位哈萨克斯坦的朋友， 他是地区安全研究员。 他也可以说四门语言，但是他不会说英文所以 我们只能用汉语交流。

我们都不是以汉语为母语的人， 可是我们可以交流的很好。 

随着中国经济的快速发展，我感觉到将来中国和普通话可能会对周边国家产生重要的影响。
那时候中国将发展到很高的水平，中国人会在全球范围内产生更多的参与性。那些能为中国从事跨境旅游和商业活动服务的国家将会从中获利。  

将来外国的学生或者商人如果想更好的和中国人展开商业活动，他们必须学习更多的中文。 英语在全球商业活动中的主导地位将受到汉语的挑战。

有些非英语国家的人不能很好地理解我说的英语，所以我也需要把英文看作是一门国际化语言，试着说更多容易让别人理解的英语，而不是只有英语国家的人才懂的俚语和方言。

我的中文翻译只是一个概要， 我的中文还不足以清晰的表达自己的观点。 请阅读英文以更好地了解我的观点。 


I recently arrived in Shanghai to study at international affairs and economics at the Shanghai Institute of International Studies SIIS.  During the last few months in Shanghai, I've discovered a new use for my burgeoning Chinese language skills. In the past, the only time that I spoke Chinese was to native Chinese speakers in somewhat limited exchanges such as explaining basic ideas to classmates or narrating simple stories or daily events. 
 
Recently, however, I have become friends with another visiting fellow here at SIIS. We share a tiny corner office, live on the same floor of the hotel, and have the mutually bonding experience of being a Lao Wai (foreigner) in China. Being from Kazakhstan, my friend only speaks Russian, Kazakh, Uyghur and Chinese. With a few languages under my belt, I can usually get around, but given that he spoke no English or the other languages I have studied, Chinese became our common language. 
 
Given that he is a scholar on regional security studies, he was capable of writing Chinese articles and giving lengthy discourses, but his spoken lexicon is simple enough that I could understand everything he said within a day or two. I'm now reaching an intermediate level of Chinese with about 1000 characters and maybe 300-500 classroom hours.  I'm starting to appreciate how difficult an endeavor it is to advance and how far I still am from reading a newspaper or having a discussion on anything of importance. 
 
So, speaking Chinese with my Kazakh friend has been excellent language practice, but the exchange also brought to mind the interesting concept of what the world would look like with Chinese as a lingua franca. While I believe English has a firm foothold as a global language, despite the difficulty of learning the language, I believe Chinese will definitely spread more rapidly than many predict.
 
Soon China will spread its influence to neighboring countries and continents as the population of 1.3 billion Chinese have higher per capita incomes and increased mobility. Record numbers of Chinese are visiting the United States despite our cultural and geographic distances. Countries that cater to Chinese tourists will benefit from China's growing  economic might.

As Chinese multinational companies grow and develop competitive advantages on a global scale, perhaps that aspiring young manager from the United States or Brazil will need a high capacity in Mandarin to close the all-important business deal. Citizens of countries that are the recipients of Chinese investments will surely see a surge in the demand to understand and speak Mandarin Chinese. 
 
Given these simple observations, I have two take-aways. 

1. The dominant position of the English language as an international medium should not be taken for granted.  At the least, Chinese will join English as an international business language. Future American business people, diplomats, and scholars may be at a disadvantage in the global marketplace if they can't speak Mandarin. 
 
2. I've realized that I also need to think about English as an international language and use it that way rather than just speaking at my regular pace with slang and idioms when speaking to non-native English speakers.  I have realized my own English is not that easy to understand for many non-native speakers and have decided it might not hurt to take a speech course in International English or teaching English as a second language.
